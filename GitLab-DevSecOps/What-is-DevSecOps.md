## What is DevSecOps ?
============================

DevSecOps stands for Development, Security, and Operations. 

It’s a software development approach that integrates security practices within the DevOps process.

It is aiming to build secure software quickly and efficiently without sacrificing speed or quality.


### Key Principles of DevSecOps :-

`Shift-Left Security` Security is addressed early in the development lifecycle, not as an afterthought.

`Automation` Security testing (e.g., static code analysis, dependency scanning, compliance checks) is automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

`Collaboration` Developers, security teams, and operations work closely to share responsibility for security.

`Continuous Monitoring` Systems are monitored for vulnerabilities and compliance continuously, even after deployment.

`Security as Code` Security policies and controls are codified and version-controlled like application code.



### DevSecOps Lifecycle :-


`Planning`

Teams define security requirements and threat models early.

Use tools like Jira, Confluence for collaboration.

Security is treated as a shared responsibility from the start.


`Development`

Developers use secure coding practices and pre-approved libraries.

Tools :-

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) – e.g., SonarQube, Checkmarx.

IDE Plugins – help catch vulnerabilities as code is written.


`Build & Test (CI/CD)`

Automated pipelines run security scans:

SAST – code analysis.

DAST (Dynamic testing) – run-time behavior testing.

Dependency Scanning – e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check.

Unit and integration tests include security tests.

`Release`

Ensure configurations follow secure baselines.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is scanned for misconfigurations.

Tools :- Terraform with Checkov or tfsec, Kubernetes YAMLs with kube-score.

`Deploy`

Use automated, secure deployment with tools like GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, ArgoCD.

Image scanning (e.g., Trivy, Clair) for container security.

`Operate`

Continuous monitoring for threats and compliance.

Tools :-

SIEM: Splunk, ELK Stack.

Runtime security: Falco, Aqua Security.

Vulnerability Management: Qualys, Tenable.

`Monitor & Respond`

Incident detection and response integrated into ops.

Feedback loops ensure that security findings lead to code fixes or pipeline adjustments.



### Why It Matters ?


Traditional security practices often slow down development. 

DevSecOps helps overcome this by ensuring security is :-

`Faster Delivery` Secure code doesn't slow down release cycles.

`Reduced Costs` Fixing issues early is cheaper than post-deployment.

`Stronger Security Posture` Continuous vigilance against threats.

`Improved Compliance` Easier audits and regulatory alignment (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA).

`Scalable` Adaptable to modern cloud-native environments.

`Consistent` Applied across all development stages.
