## GitLab CI/CD
======================

GitLab CI/CD is a built-in continuous integration and continuous deployment system. 

It’s tightly integrated into the GitLab platform and configured through a single YAML file in your repository.

It automates :-

 - Building your application
 - Testing it for bugs or security issues
 - Deploying it to production or staging environments



### CI/CD Pipeline Basics


A CI/CD pipeline is an automated sequence of steps that takes code from version control and :-

 - Builds it
 - Tests it
 - Deploys it

This process reduces manual work and helps teams deliver reliable software faster.


`CI vs. CD`

CI (Continuous Integration)	= Automatically builds and tests code when changes are pushed.

CD (Continuous Delivery)	= Automatically prepares or delivers code to production or staging after successful CI.

CD (Continuous Deployment)	= Code is automatically deployed to users once tests pass—no manual approval needed.


`Key Components`

Stages :- Define the flow of the pipeline (e.g., build, test, deploy).

Jobs :- Tasks in each stage that run scripts.

Runners :- Agents that execute the jobs (can be shared or self-hosted).

Scripts :- Shell commands that run during each job.


`Pipeline Execution`


Developer pushes code to GitLab.

GitLab looks for .gitlab-ci.yml.

Pipeline starts and runs jobs stage-by-stage.


### Pipeline Components

1. Stages
   
List of pipeline phases (in execution order)

These are the major phases in your pipeline.

```
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
```

2. Jobs
   

Each job runs scripts within a stage. Jobs in the same stage run in parallel; stages run in order.   

Tasks that run in each stage, such as :-

 - Installing dependencies
 - Running unit tests
 - Deploying to a server


3. Scripts
   

List of shell commands to run in the job

Shell commands executed by the job

Commands that each job will execute


4. Runners

   
The agents that execute your jobs (GitLab provides shared runners or you can self-host).


6. Artifacts & Caches


Artifacts :-  Files generated by jobs (e.g., compiled code, test results).

Cache :-  Stores dependencies to speed up pipeline runs.
